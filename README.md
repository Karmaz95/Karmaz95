### :man_technologist: &nbsp;About Me
`Head of Research` at [afine](https://afine.com/), specializing in üçé **macOS security**. Passionate about üõ†Ô∏è **Vulnerability Research**, üéØ **Exploit Development**, and üîç **Reverse Engineering**. My work focuses on **macOS internals** and advancing research in offensive security.  

While research is my primary focus, I also work as an **Offensive Security Engineer**, identifying üëæ **security flaws** and developing ü§ñ **tools** to enhance security operations. This includes üñ•Ô∏è **Desktop Application Security**, üï∏Ô∏è **Web Application Security**, üí† **Active Directory**, and creating ü¶† **malware** to bypass üõ°Ô∏è **EDRs**.

### üî≠ Projects
I created some tools helpful for Offensive Security work, but there are two that I am the proudest of:
* [Snake&Apple](https://github.com/Karmaz95/Snake_Apple) - The code repository for the [Snake&Apple article series](https://medium.com/@karol-mazurek/list/snakeapple-50baea541374) documents my macOS security research.
* [Crimson](https://github.com/Karmaz95/crimson) - This was my first big thing. Currently, I am not focusing on this tool. However, it is still powerful. My friends and I are using it to this day. This is also a great place to start your journey with Application Security.

### üêõ CVE
As part of my daily work and free-time research, I am looking for bugs üêõ. 
I have caught many of them so far, and [some have even received a public CVE](https://github.com/Karmaz95/Credits). I am particularly proud of [CVE-2023-35359: Windows - Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-35359).
