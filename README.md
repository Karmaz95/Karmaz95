### :man_technologist: &nbsp;About Me
I am the Head of Research at [AFINE](https://afine.com/), specializing in macOS security. I am passionate about vulnerability research, exploit development, and reverse engineering. My work focuses on macOS internals and advancing research in offensive security. 

My primary focus is research, but I also work as an Offensive Security Engineer, identifying security flaws and developing tools to enhance security operations in desktop and web application security, Active Directory, and creating malware to bypass EDR.

### üî≠ Projects
I created some tools helpful for Offensive Security work, but there are two that I am the proudest of:
* [Snake&Apple](https://github.com/Karmaz95/Snake_Apple) - The code repository for the [Snake&Apple article series](https://medium.com/@karol-mazurek/list/snakeapple-50baea541374) documents my macOS security research.
* [Crimson](https://github.com/Karmaz95/crimson) - This was my first big thing. Currently, I am not focusing on this tool. However, it is still powerful. My friends and I are using it to this day. This is also a great place to start your journey with Application Security.

### üêõ CVE
As part of my daily work and free-time research, I am looking for bugs. 
I have caught many of them so far, and [some have even received a public CVE](https://github.com/Karmaz95/Credits). I am particularly proud of [CVE-2023-35359: Windows - Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-35359).
