### :man_technologist: &nbsp;About Me :
I am a passionate `Offensive Security Engineer` from [afine](https://afine.com/), committed to finding 👾 **bugs** and developing 🤖  **software** that enhances our work in security. My main areas of interest are 🍎 **macOS internals** and 🕸️ **web application security**. Although I have experience in 💠 **Active Directory** and creating 🦠 **malware** to bypass 🛡️ **EDRs**, I am no longer pursuing knowledge in these areas.

### 🔭 Projects I am proud of :
I created some tools helpful for Offensive Security work, but there are two that I am the most proud of, they are:
* [Crimson](https://github.com/Karmaz95/crimson) - this was my first big thing. Currently, I am not focusing on this tool. However, it is still powerful. My friends and I are using it to this day. This is also a great place to start your journey with Application Security.
* [Snake&Apple](https://github.com/Karmaz95/Snake_Apple) - The code repository for the [Snake&Apple article series](https://medium.com/@karol-mazurek/list/snakeapple-50baea541374) documents my macOS security research.

### 🐛 CVE I am proud of :
As my daily work and some part of my free time research, I am looking for bugs 🐛. 
I have caught many of them so far, and some have even received a public CVE. I am particularly proud of these two:
* [CVE-2023-35359 - Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-35359)
* [Hummingbird < 3.4.2 - Unauthenticated Path Traversal](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/512a9ba4-01c0-4614-a991-efdc7fe51abe)
