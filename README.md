### :man_technologist: &nbsp;About Me
I am the Head of Research at [AFINE](https://afine.com/), specializing in macOS security. I am passionate about vulnerability research, exploit development, and reverse engineering. My work focuses on macOS internals. I also work as an Offensive Security Engineer, developing tools to enhance security operations, identifying vulnerabilities in Desktop/Web applications, Active Directory, and creating malware to bypass EDRs.
